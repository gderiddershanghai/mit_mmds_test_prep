Streamlit powers this interactive test aid designed to support students in their preparation for exams on graph theory. The app tests your knowledge of lecture notes, Newman's book on networks, and any papers mentioned in the lectures. You will find a variety of question types including:

1. **Multiple Choice Questions**: Assess your understanding with multiple-choice questions based on the lecture notes and readings.
2. **Open-ended Questions**: Explore deeper thought questions that encourage comprehensive understanding of graph theory concepts.
3. **Chart & Graph Interpretation**: Test your skills in interpreting charts and graphs related to graph theory and network analysis.

Get started by selecting a practice category from the dropdown on the left and enhance your exam preparation.
